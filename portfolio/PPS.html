      <p class="h6 text-left font-weight-light mb-0">
        <br>
        We were approached by Pennsylvania Prison Society (PPS) to assist them with a UX problem. For a little background, PPS is the oldest inmate protection organization in the country, and it works to better the conditions of incarcerated people across the state. They do this primarily through sending in Official Visitors (OV) – volunteers who are granted special access to incarcerated people and advocates for issues and concerns of incarcerated people.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, they found that many of their OVs did not consistently document their visits to incarcerated individuals so they wanted a method that would create and encourage consistent documentation across the volunteers in the commonwealth.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      </p>
      <p class="h5 text-left font-weight-bold mb-0">The Stakes </p>
      <p class="h6 text-left font-weight-light mb-0">
        As an organization, PPS sometimes recieves repeat statements/reports from different incarcerated individuals within the same facility. These repeat reports often indicate patterns that can be instrumental in improving the incarcerated individuals' conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, one individual experienced sexual abuse from a corrections officer (CO). Sometime later, PPS recieved another report from another individual who experienced sexual abuse and the same CO's name showed up. Because there was thorough documentation of both of these occurences, PPS was able to build a case against the CO and have them removed. If Official Volunteers can create consistent documentation, PPS can analyze patterns and fight systematic injustices within the prison system.

      Based on the recurring ideas within our research and usability testing, our final design was an information managing system which accommodates various report behaviors from different chapters and assists the main office to file and assign requests. We reduced the flow of a request to some core questions which was applicable to multiple platforms like google forms, a phone conversational user interface, and a web application. This breadth of application was intended to cater to the diversity of volunteers and their workflows.

    <p class="h6 text-left font-weight-light mb-0">
      We conducted contextual inquiries on target users/actors, such as graduate students who use and didn’t use the escorts and a member of the GSA to further understand how the shuttle/escort system operates. The goal was to understand the users behavior in regards to how to get to and from campus, problems they have had, other services they use, etc… After the inquiry we created notes from the interview and found patterns within the notes.

      We found several themes (the green post-its): information about shuttles, expectations of shuttles, adoption of shuttle, and alternatives to shuttles.

      Here are several (blue) notes that were impactful to overall research process:

    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="h6 text-left font-weight-light mb-0">
      After completely understanding the landscape we were operating in, we started diving into understanding user needs. We asked similar questions to the previous contextual inquiry but we added a focus on how users acquired information about the service. From the inquiry, we found that the shuttle service is useful because it is only for CMU students and therefore meets the needs of this population. Many people mentioned that the service feels safe because only CMU students are on the shuttles. We also found out that some students who live off-campus feel that their commute is scary, which shows a need for a safe and reliable method of transportation and highlights the positive aspects of the shuttle and escort services. However, we also found out that the accessibility of the shuttle service information is poor. Most

          <i>students did not fully understand how to use the shuttle service,
          </i>
        </b>
      even though the shuttle service can be very valuable, as previously stated. Students did not feel the need to learn more about the service because the information is difficult to attain and not well-advertised by the university. One undergraduate even thought that the shuttle service was only for graduate students, even though the shuttles are meant to benefit the entire university population. Some thought the shuttles were only for commuting, when the service offers bus stops around nearby grocery stores, which most of our interviewees usually get to through a rideshare service.

      With all those findings, we were on our way to potential solution. Our team went onto figma and designed different iterations of the same task (showing procedural information). We were fleshing out the idea of integrating the shuttle and escort service into Google Maps. With the design artifact, we conducted several five second tests.

      Our solution focuses on ensuring familiarity and visibility of the CMU transportation services. By exposing CMU transportation options within Google Maps, a commonly used transportation app among students, users can easily choose to use CMU services when appropriate.

      Anna is a CMU undergraduate student who lives off campus. She has never used the CMU shuttle or escort services before but decided to give the new Google Maps plug-in a try. Late at night, Anna types in the address to her house and finds that the Yellow Zone shuttle can drop her off near her home.

      <br>
      <br>
      She clicks on the escort option to view further directions. A pop-up screen shows her how to use the escort system. Anna is relieved to have known this information and now feels more prepared to ride the escort.

      <br>
      <br>
      After she dismisses the pop-up screen, Anna is able to view real-time information and detailed directions on where she can get on and off the escort. Anna is glad to have found a safe new method to go home late at night.
